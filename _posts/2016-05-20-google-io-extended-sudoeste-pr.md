So this week I had a talk on Google I/O Extended, the local version of the event that takes place after the regular global Google broadcast. 

I took the chance to talk about nodeJS and more specifically about SailsJS, this amazing NodeJS Framework that have been making the life a lot more easy the past few months at Tagon8. 

The main focus of my speach was to introduce SailsJS to the local developers community, where the Web development tech most used by local companies is currently Java and/or Ruby.

The full event speak can be found on youtube. And the presentation I used can be found on SlideShare.
